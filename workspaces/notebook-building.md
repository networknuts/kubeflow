To be compatible with **Kubeflow NotebookController**, your container image must meet the following requirements:

---

## ðŸ“¡ 1. Expose HTTP on Port `8888`

- Your application must listen on **port 8888**.
- Kubeflow injects an environment variable called `NB_PREFIX` at runtime.  
  Your application must respect this prefix in its base URL (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:8888${NB_PREFIX}`).

---

## ðŸ§© 2. IFrame Support (Headers Required)

Kubeflow embeds notebook interfaces via **iframes**.  
Your HTTP server **must** set the following CORS header:

```

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

```

Failing to set this will prevent the UI from rendering properly inside the dashboard.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ 3. Run as User `jovyan`

Your container must:

- Run as user: `jovyan`
- Home directory: `/home/jovyan`
- UID: `1000`

This is required to maintain compatibility with Kubeflow's volume mounts and user permissions.

---

## ðŸ’¾ 4. Tolerate an Empty PVC Mounted at `/home/jovyan`

- Kubeflow mounts a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** at `/home/jovyan`.
- Your container must **start successfully** even if this directory is **empty**.

This ensures notebook data persists across restarts and reassignments.
